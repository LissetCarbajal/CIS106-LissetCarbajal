I am taking this class because I am working on my computer support associate degree, last year I earned a certificate in computer support
I want to earn a higher degree and hope to do well in this class,  I am excited to learn more about computer programming,
it may seem confusing looking at all the numbers and letters but I hope to do good. I think technology is exciting to learn
more about because there is always something new going on and there are a lot of great opportunities in the IT field
every day there is something new, technology is always advancing which I think is pretty cool.
I love using technology every day, and I think I made a good decision switching to the IT field
when I first started college I was in the medical field but realized that was not for me.
